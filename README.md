# Blockchain-Powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending Platform

## Overview
This project is a **Blockchain-powered Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending platform** that allows borrowers and lenders to interact directly without intermediaries. By leveraging **blockchain technology** and **smart contracts**, the platform ensures **secure, transparent, and automated loan transactions**.

Traditional financial systems rely on banks or lending institutions, which can introduce delays, high fees, and fraud risks. This decentralized system removes intermediaries, reduces costs, and promotes financial inclusion.

## Features

- **Decentralization:** No central authority; data is stored on a blockchain network across multiple nodes.
- **Smart Contracts:** Loan creation, funding, and repayments are automated and self-enforcing.
- **Enhanced Security:** Blockchain ensures immutability and prevents tampering.
- **Transparency & Trust:** All transactions and loan details are visible to participants.
- **Global Access:** Enables cross-border lending without complex banking regulations.
- **Automated Repayment:** Smart contracts track repayments and enforce penalties if necessary.

---

## Architecture

- **Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet for testing)
- **Smart Contracts:** Written in Solidity to manage loan lifecycle.
- **Frontend:** React.js with Ethers.js / Web3.js for blockchain interaction.
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask for secure transaction signing.
- **Backend (Optional):** NoSQL database (MongoDB) for off-chain data like user profiles.

## Methodology

1. Borrowers create a loan request specifying:
   - Loan amount
   - Interest rate
   - Repayment duration
2. Lenders browse and fund loans directly.
3. Smart contracts automatically handle:
   - Fund transfer
   - Repayment tracking
   - Interest calculation
   - Penalties (if applicable)
4. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

## Existing vs Proposed System

| Aspect                | Existing P2P Platforms          | Proposed Blockchain P2P Platform |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Intermediary          | Centralized platform           | None (decentralized)            |
| Security              | Centralized database, vulnerable | Blockchain ledger, immutable   |
| Transparency          | Limited                        | Fully transparent               |
| Cross-border Lending  | Complicated                    | Seamless and borderless         |
| Transaction Fees      | Higher due to middlemen        | Lower due to automation         |
